// Midterm Review

/*
	Format: In-class + Take-home
		- Closed Book!
		- 55% straight from lectures / assignments.
		- Three special questions (star problems; ~15 points each).
			- Do at least one in class; the rest can be done at home.
			- Coding questions involving stacks, queues, or linked lists. WRITTEN QUESTIONS.
				- Ex: Reverse a Linked List - Function is all that matters, not the chunk / linked list class.
				- Shouldn't be writing ~40-50 lines of code. ~20 should be enough (30 with blank spaces).
			- +10 bonus points & free lunch if you complete ALL in class!

	Topics: REVIEW!!! STUDY!!!
		- Big-O notation, growth functions.

## I. GETTING IN TOUCH

Email is probably the best form of communication. I do get a lot of emails, but I am reasonably prompt in replying to them all. Besides online communication, I will alos be happy to see you during or outside my office hours, just send an email! My office is **in Howe**, and my office hours are **Monday, 2.00 pm - 4.00 pm**.

## II. GRADING POLICY

Grading is loosely comprised of homeworks (55%), midterms (40%), and class participation (5%). I use a +/- grading scheme.

## III. SUBMISSIONS

Homeworks, take-homes, and projects are typically submitted online on Canvas. A portal for submissions will be made available at appropiate time.

## IV. COURSE SYLLABUS

* Analysis of Algorithms: Time complexity, Space (storage) complexity, Big-O, small-O, and theta notations
* Solving problems using programming: Functions (modular programming), Object oriented programming (classes/objects), Recursion, Analyzing algorithms involving recursive forms using telescoping and substitution.
* Simple (linear) Data Structures: Linked Lists, Doubly linked lists, Stacks (push, pop, display), and Queues (enqueue, dequeue, display).
* Trees (non-linear data structures): Tree definitions and properties, Tree traversals (pre-, post-, in-order), Tree operations (insert, delete), Expression trees (Prefix, Infix, Postfix).
* Binary Search Trees: Lookup, Insert, Delete and Traversals.
* Priority Queues (PQ), PQ using linked lists, Heap as PQ
* Advanced Data Structures (time permitting): Self balancing trees, including Red Black Trees (creation) and AVL Trees
* Sorting: Bubble sort, Quick-sort, Mega-sort, Insertion-sort, and Heap-sort.
* Hash Tables: Hashing functions, Lookup using Hash Tables, Separate chaining, Linear probing, and Quadratic probing.

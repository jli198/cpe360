        format:
    in class + take home
    about 40% of the questions are going to be straight from the lecture/assignments
    then 3 star problems, about 15% each
    these will be coding questions
    you have to do at least one of these star problems in person during class, the other 2 you can take home
    they will be the final 3 questions in the exam

    the rest of the problems will be straight from lecture/Assignments

    if you do all 3 star problems in class and get them all right, you get bonus 10 points and Mukund will buy you lunch
    the star questions will be some new weird thing to be done to a data structure
    ex. reverse a linked list (assume that the classes are already there, all you have to do is write the function)
    if you write more than 30-40 lines of code for the function, you are probably going down an incorrect path
    they should be pretty quick

        TOPICS:
    analysis of algorithms - big O notation
    variabes - static, constant, and pointers for regular varibales
    functions and recursion - writing simple functions using recursion
    infix to postfix - using stacks
    linear lists - stacks, queues, and linked lists

    *study tip: google stack, queue, and linked lists interview questions and learn those
    watch the infix postfix lecture video
